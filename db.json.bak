      "date": "10.03.21",
      "content": "Modern consumers are savvy, they demand transparency and see through posturing. Authentic communication is what businesses are striving for and what consumers demand.  COVID 19 has shone a light on the importance of companies making a profit but ethically and with integrity. Businesses are being challenged on multiple levels with consumers asking questions about their communications and about their business core values, for instance, how a business treats their employees? How they’re contributing to causes? How the company makes a profit? What is their record on environmental impact? People are making distinctions based on the modus operandi of a company and its products, not purely on product benefits.   Take, for example, H & M the Swedish clothes chain whose mission is “To drive long-lasting positive change and improve living conditions by investing in people, communities and innovative ideas.”  They repurposed their supply chain to make PPE for medical staff and emerged strongly."
